Project update October 5 2018 - Karsten Pease
===============================================
Non-functional items
I will plain on testing the performance of the website and making sure it works by using some testing libraries such as, node-jsdom or PhantomJS, I will look into more of those as we get closer to the testing phases. I will also have several users use the website and let me know if they ran into any trouble with it or if the site was slow in any way. 

The best way I see to get a server online  is to share a host by going to a hosting company such as Awardspace or Zymic. I will also need to get a domain name with won't be too bad because they are only about $10 a year. Once I have both components for the Host and domain name I will need to link the two together, with is a common especially with the websites provided. There are many articles describing how to connect a host and domain name, I think I could have that done in less than a week. 

I think that uploading the pages on the websites homepage will be best as hard code, because If a change is wanted I can easily get into the code and change one picture. It will also be very easy to teach my client about the changes to make. 

I am actually having second thoughts about using an instagram API, I will do research into finding a way to link different files of pictures on the gallery page. 

Presentation-

I will present all parts of my project by showing what I have so far and talking about what I plan on doing in the future. While I talk about the plan I have for later development, I will touch on the difficult sections and parts that might be an easy solution. Tools I will use will probably be just the website and maybe a powerpoint, as of right now I know my project well and do not see a need to make a powerpoint, when I can just run the website itself.
