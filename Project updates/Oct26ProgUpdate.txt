Project Update #9 Oct 26 2018
Karsten Pease

So far in my project the main changes I have made are making a personal page and having it completed. I interviewed my client and got a list of questions I provided and he answered them for me. This way it provides a different and I think creative approach to his personal page instead of just listing facts about himself. Now it shows an interview of who he is and why is is into photography. 

I also will be getting the pictures for the gallery and will meet them into files and post them into different sections soon. My client said that he did research on other photography websites and decided not to put a water mark on his work. While I think this will make it easier for people to take his ideas he is not worried about that. 

I am currently doing research on Jango Main and his PayPal functions, these will be 2 things that will take some time getting right and I will want to get a full understanding before I commit them to the project. 

I have done all the work up to this point, and I will end up doing the rest of the work. I am such a fair teammate.
