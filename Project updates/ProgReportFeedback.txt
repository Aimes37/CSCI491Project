Karsten Pease	Progress Report Oct19
=======================================
Some of the changes I will make to my project are first, the payment process. After discussing with my client how he would like to go about payment, he diced that using a PayPal method is best. At first he was alright with the idea of using email but I told him that it is a major security risk and he decided to go with PayPal. Transactions will be used with PayPal but, the email will be used for communication between client and potential buyer. 


Another correction I have decided to make is the way of maintenance. I have decided, for the current semester, to put all the different pictures and tile types on the site locally. I will next semester make a database through the back-end development phases. 

I will do some server type work on the project this semester, I will incorporate the email to go through and sent to my clients email. With this I will need to set up an anti spam filter for the email so that a malicious opponent cant create havoc in his email. I have also received confirmation from him that using google bots to reference his pictures on his website will fine by him.
