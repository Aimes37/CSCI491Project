Karsten Pease Update November 16,

I have gotten my PayPal button on and working, all I need to do now is get the information  from the client at what sizes he wants and at what prices, and finally his email on pay pal. Once I obtain these, I can make the PayPal function operational. 

I also have gotten a domain name for my website and am ready to link it to my host.

The place I have decided to host my website on is heroku. This is a free way to host a site and an easy solution to link GoDaddy.com domains.  

The last think I need to do besides PayPal fully operational and link host and domain is get the email  to work though the server with a spam filter. 

I plain to work on this and have most of the project done after thanksgiving break.
