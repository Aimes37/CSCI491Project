Project Update September 21, Karsten Pease

I have talked to my other group members and they were ok with my departure. 

I have attached a picture of what files this project will have and how they will interact with each other, I am thinking Having a Home, experience, contact, and a gallery page for the website. A JavaScript file and css page will be included for more complicated styling and functionality. 

I will test this project by  using white box testing mainly.

Types of software I will use is, bootstrap version 4 (already have nice looking nav bar with instagram link). Something else I need to look into  is using google drive so that all pictures will go directly from there onto the website. Making maintaining a lot easier.
